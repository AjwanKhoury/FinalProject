# Final Project
## Autonomous car
Autonomous vehicles are automobiles that can move without any intervention by detecting the road, traffic flow and surrounding objects with the help of the control system they have. These vehicles can detect objects around them by using technologies and techniques such as RADAR,  GPS, Odometry, Computer Vision. The autopilot drive of autonomous vehicles starts briefly with the ultrasonic sensors on its wheels, detecting the positions of vehicles that are braking or parked, and data from a wide range of sensors(Cameras , GPS etc..) are analysed with a central computer system and events such as steering control, braking and acceleration are performed.
